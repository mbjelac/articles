James Coplien should take it easy

Today I saw a talk from James Colien on this year's GOTO conference: "The Dehumanisation of Agile and Objects"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrBQmIDdls4&t=2959s

The introductory history was interesting. Other talks on the subject usually don't include such visually clear descriptions.

However, after the intro, the talk gradually transitioned into a rant about how agile and OOP are ruined ("driven into the ground") by various culprits, one of them being TDD.

I'm a TDD-er so naturally I have to say something on the subject. :)

I agree that unit testing using TDD cannot bring about a well-designed system which meets customer requirements.
The best you can do with unit-level TDD is to have clean units of code that do exactly what you wanted them to do when yo wrote their unit tests.
Nothing more and nothing less. 



"Yeah, like THATS gonna work!"


objects are user's mental model vs. interface is everything
